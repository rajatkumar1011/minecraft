![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

A sleek, modern, and customizable web wrapper for the official [Minecraft Classic](https://classic.minecraft.net/).

This project embeds the `classic.minecraft.net` game within a custom-built interface, providing a clean, futuristic aesthetic. It adds features like a themeable UI, a controls guide, and a dedicated fullscreen mode, all powered by clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

* **Glow Aesthetic:** A dark, "glassmorphic" UI with a dynamic, glowing border.
* **Customizable Theme:** Change the UI's accent and glow color from the settings modal.
* **Controls Panel:** An easy-access info modal displaying all game controls.
* **Immersive Fullscreen:** A dedicated button to take the game wrapper into fullscreen mode.
* **Clean Interface:** All functionality is tucked into a minimalist sidebar.
* **Robust UX:** Includes a loading screen and toast notifications for a smoother experience.
